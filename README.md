WebComics is a lightweight, front-end–only platform designed for seamless, vertical-scroll comic reading—much like Webtoon. Built with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers genre-based browsing, autoplay thumbnail previews, intuitive swipe or scroll navigation, and responsive layouts for mobile and desktop. Without any back-end dependencies, all comic content is loaded directly in the browser, ensuring fast load times and a smooth, app-like reading experience.
