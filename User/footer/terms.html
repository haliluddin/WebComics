            <h2>10. Fees</h2><br>
            <p>You might have to pay fees to WEBCOMIC for purchasing Coins or using specific Services features (Service Fees). You're responsible for paying these fees as listed on the platform. If fees are recurring, WEBCOMIC can charge them to your specified Payment Method. By using this method, you authorize WEBCOMIC to charge Service Fees, additional service fees, and applicable taxes. Fees may change,
                 and new features may have additional fees, with advance notice from WEBCOMIC. Third-party payment processors may handle these fees on WEBCOMIC's behalf, and WEBCOMIC isn't liable for errors caused by them.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>11. Termination and Suspension</h2><br>
            <p>You have the right to stop using the Services anytime. WEBCOMIC can modify, suspend, or terminate access to the Services or Digital Content for any reason, with or without notice. They may also interrupt service for maintenance or changes. If you violate the Agreement, your rights automatically terminate, requiring you to stop using the Service. WEBCOMIC can revoke your access if necessary and may suspend access if terms are not followed. WEBCOMIC's failure to enforce terms doesn't waive their rights or remedies.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>12. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2><br>
            <p>our use of the Services and Digital Content is at your own risk. WEBCOMIC and its licensors provide the Services and Digital Content "as is" without any warranty, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, security, or non-infringement. WEBCOMIC disclaims responsibility for interruptions, errors, viruses, or damage to devices or data.

WEBCOMIC is not responsible for third-party products or services 
                advertised through the Services. Users should exercise caution and judgment. No advice or information from WEBCOMIC creates a warranty not explicitly stated. Some jurisdictions may not allow certain warranty limitations, in which case specific provisions may apply.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2><br>
            <p>WEBCOMIC and its affiliates are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, breach of warranty or contract, negligence, or any legal theory related to the Services. This includes loss of profits, data, or use of the Services, and any errors or inaccuracies in content. WEBCOMIC is also not liable for third-party content or conduct.

            <br><br>
            <h2>14. Indemnification</h2><br>
            <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless WEBCOMIC, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, agents, partners, and employees from any losses, liabilities, claims, expenses, and legal fees arising from your use of the Services, Digital Content, or User Postings.

            <br><br>
            <h2>15. Governing Law: Disputes</h2><br>
            <p>a) If accessing the Services is illegal in your country or for you personally, you're responsible for complying with local laws.<br>
                <br>b) The Agreement is governed by the laws of California, excluding any conflict of law provisions.<br>
                <br>c) Any legal disputes not resolved by arbitration under Section 17 will be brought exclusively in federal or state courts in Los Angeles, California. You waive objections to jurisdiction and venue in these courts.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>16. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2><br>
            <p>a) <span>Notice of Dispute</span>. If there's a dispute, you or WEBCOMIC must provide a written statement with contact information, facts of the dispute, and a proposed solution. Try to resolve it informally for 60 days, then arbitration can start if needed.<br>
                <br>b) <span>Mediation, Binding Arbitration and Governing Law</span>. Try mediation first; if that fails, resolve disputes through binding arbitration. No class actions allowed. Arbitration location is Los Angeles, California.<br>
                <br>c) <span>Class Action Waiver</span>. Disputes must be handled individually, not as class actions. <br>
                <br>d) <span>Mass Arbitrations</span>. If 25+ similar disputes arise, they're resolved in stages through arbitration.<br>
                <br>e) <span>Arbitration Procedures</span>. Follow JAMS rules for arbitration. Telephonic hearings are common for disputes under $10,000 unless an in-person hearing is justified.<br>
                <br>f) <span>Arbitration Fees</span>. Whoever files arbitration pays initial fees. Each party bears its own legal expenses unless the arbitrator decides otherwise.<br>
                <br>g) <span>Filing Period</span>. Disputes must be filed within one year in arbitration, starting from when the claim first arises.<br>
                <br>h) <span> Opt-Out</span>. You can opt out of arbitration within 30 days of agreeing to the terms or receiving notice of changes to the arbitration provision.

            <h2>17. Complete Agreement and Severability</h2><br>
            <p>This paragraph essentially states that the Agreement is the complete agreement between you and WEBCOMIC regarding the Services and Digital Content, replacing any previous understandings. If any part of the Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that specific part will be disregarded, but the rest of the Agreement will remain valid and enforceable.</p>
