           <h2>1. Content Guidelines</h2><br>
           <p>a) <span>Intellectual Property Rights</span>. You must own the copyrights to what you upload, and you can't share copyrighted content without permission. Unauthorized content may be taken down by rights holders.<br><br>
            b) <span>User-Identifying, Abusive or Hateful Content</span>. Don't share personal info about others, and avoid hateful or abusive content. Violations may result in account suspension or removal.<br><br>
            c) <span>Mature or Sexual Content</span>. No nudity or sexually explicit content is allowed, and use the "Mature Content Warning" for mature themes. Failure to comply may lead to episodes or series being removed or made inaccessible.<br><br>
            d) <span>Violent or Graphic Content</span>. Avoid graphic violence, sexual assault depictions, promoting harm, or glorifying self-harm/suicide. Violations can result in content removal or account suspension.<br><br>
            e) <span>Dangerous or Illegal Content</span>. Don't promote dangerous activities, illegal substances, or misinformation. Violators may face account suspension or removal.<br><br>
            f) <span>Advertising</span>. Get approval for sponsored content, and don't use automated or fake interactions. Violations may lead to account suspension or removal.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>2. Community Code of Conduct</h2><br>
            <p>Due to our community values, in particular the commandment of mutual respect, the following actions are prohibited on CANVAS and on the WEBCOMIC community:<br><br>
                a) Any form of insulting, obscene, disrespectful, harassing and hurtful statements, posts or other behavior on CANVAS.<br>
                b) Any form of hate speech and verbal abuse, especially extremist or aggressive statements.<br>
                c) Any sexual comments, postings, links, or jokes, sexual advances, or similar behavior.<br>
                d) Any form of intimidation, harassment or threats on CANVAS, including stalking.<br>
                e) Posting or threatening to post personal information about others (e.g., real name, contact information, address, etc.).<br>
                f) Posting copyright infringing content or distributing links to copyright infringing content on other websites or services.<br>
                g) Excessive, meaningless, harassing or offensive posts or posting of unwanted links.<br>
                h) Creation of accounts or Creator Profiles or uploading of content for the primary purpose of driving traffic to external websites.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>3. Potentially Unlawful Content and Conduct</h2><br>
            <p>We reserve the right to remove content and discipline conduct that we deem, in our sole discretion, to be harmful or potentially unlawful. Examples of harmful or potentially unlawful content or conduct include (i) defamatory content or conduct, (ii) factually false or deceptive content or conduct, (iii) content or content that violates the privacy rights of another person, and (iii) content or conduct that violate the applicable laws or are prohibited by law.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>4. Reporting Inappropriate Content</h2><br>
            <p>a) <span>Reporting Comments and Posts</span>. Users can report comments, posts, or other content on Creator Profiles that violate guidelines or terms of use by clicking the "Report" link below the content. Reported material will be reviewed by the moderation team, and violations may result in content removal.<br><br>
                b) <span>Reporting Series and Episodes: Removal</span>. To report episodes that violate content guidelines, users can click the "Report" button at the end of the relevant episodes. Episodes with multiple reports may be automatically removed pending further review. Repeated reports on the same episode or series, if justified, may lead to removal and a warning for the creator. Further actions like blocking the creator's content posting or account may also be taken by WEBCOMIC.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>5. Copyright Infringement</h2><br>
            <p>a) <span>Reporting Copyright Infringement</span>. Copyright owners or authorized agents can send a take-down notice to dmcanotice@WEBCOMIC.com with proof of ownership, identification of infringing content and its URL, a statement of good faith, contact information, and a signature. 
                Upon receiving a valid notice, WEBCOMIC will remove the infringing content and notify the user. If no response is received within 14 days, the content remains blocked.<br><br>
                b) <span>Counter-Notice</span>. Users who believe their content was wrongly removed can send a counter-notice to dmcanotice@WEBCOMIC.com with identification of the removed content, a statement of good faith, a request for content restoration, consent to forward the notice, contact information, and a signature. 
                Upon receiving a valid counter-notice, WEBCOMIC may forward it to the original notifier. The original notifier then has 10 business days to take legal action. If no action is taken, access to the content may be restored in 14 days.<br><br>
                c) <span>Supplementing Incomplete Notices</span>. If a notice or counter-notice is incomplete, WEBCOMIC may request additional information within 5 business days. Failure to provide the requested information within this timeframe will result in the notice or counter-notice being deemed not sent.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>6. Violations of this Guidelines.</h2><br>
            <p>a) In addition to any remedies available to us in the Terms of Use, we reserve the right to take any action we deem appropriate in response to violations of this Guidelines. Users who violate this Guidelines may be suspended from posting or submitting User Postings (temporarily or permanently) or have their account and access to the Services suspended or terminated.<br><br>
                b) While we generally attempt to provide advance notice to users of actions we take in response to Guidelines violations, we may elect not to do so at our sole discretion. As a result, violations of Guidelines or the Terms of Use may result in permanent loss of User Postings and other content previously accessible through the Services.<br><br>
                c) If your content has been removed or suspended due to Guidelines violations, you may contact our Creator Support team at creatorsupport@WEBCOMIC.com. However, please note that we do not offer an appeal process for actions we take in response to violations of this Guidelines.</p>
